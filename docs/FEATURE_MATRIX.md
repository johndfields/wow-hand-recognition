## Additional Features

| Feature | Simple Implementation | Modular Implementation | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Audio Feedback | ❌ | ✅ | Only in modular implementation (stub) |
| Statistics Tracking | ❌ | ✅ | Only in modular implementation (stub) |
| Crash Handling | ❌ | ✅ | Only in modular implementation (stub) |
| Multi-Hand Support | ❌ | ✅ | Only in modular implementation |
| Command Line Arguments | ❌ | ✅ | Only in modular implementation |
| State Saving/Loading | ❌ | ✅ | Only in modular implementation |

## Conclusion

The modular implementation offers significantly more features and better architecture, but several features are only implemented as stubs. The simple implementation has a few unique gesture types not present in the modular version. The consolidation should preserve all working features from both implementations while leveraging the superior architecture of the modular system.
